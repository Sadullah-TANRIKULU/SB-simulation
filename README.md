## What I plan to do

* if customer wants lemonade, i can not deliver book
customer wants just 1 product, i should not be able to deliver many to same customer

* recursive setTimeout function could be used to make it similar to real life 
  - in regular monthly financial timeframes (40 secs)
  - randomized customers like in real life(3, 7, 11 secs)
